This is the same “Hypertext” included in the “http” you see at the start of URLs in the browser, as it’s part of how browsers will know how to render what you provide. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to use HTML to add elements to display within a browser window, just as you would do with a webpage.\n\nHTML is a common starting point for those looking to get into web development. Later in the course, you’ll combine it with CSS, and even later in the Nanodegree, with Javascript, to create a full web experience. HTML itself is very much the basic building block of the web.",

With HTML, tags help tell the browser how to render different elements on the page, especially once you get into the styling with CSS later, where the tags will point to specific styles to use throughout your webpage. We will just briefly cover these here, as you’ll see more on them when we discuss the DOM.\n\n#### `<!DOCTYPE html>`\n\nNearly every web document using HTML will start with this. This just tells the browser it is rendering an HTML document.\n\n#### `<html>` and `</html>`\n\nThe first of these will likely be right after the doctype tag, while the second will “close” this tag, and won’t be present until the end of the HTML document. These note that everything in between is HTML code.\n\n#### `<body>` and `</body>`\n\nThe body is where most of the content you will actually see on your webpage goes. It is closed with a `</body>` tag. Note that in basic examples, it is not actually required, as the page assumes other content is within the body, but by the end of this lesson you should be using this regularly. There is actually a `<head>` section that can come before the body, but we will skip that for now.\n\nHere is just a very brief example of how these might look in practice, without anything filled into the body yet.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <!-- Page content would go here -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWe will start seeing all of these in practice soon!",

You can also use a code editor like VS Code on your own computer, but these workspaces will allow you to do your work in the classroom environment as well.\n\nFirst off, if you want more space, you can click “Expand” at the bottom of the workspace, and the workspace will switch to full-screen. We have included the instructions here within the `Instructions.md` file in the `/home/workspace` directory so you can still refer to them when the workspace is in full-screen mode.\n\nThe layout of this HTML Live Preview Workspace is as follows:\n\n- On the left is the directory view. You can view any files in the current directory here. Additionally, you can click the `+` button at the top to either create or download files or folders. (That’s a hint for this first exercise)\n- In the middle is the code window. Any files you click to open will be shown here, with tabs at the top to switch between open files. You can code here; the files will automatically save, and if applicable, update in the window on the right after a few seconds delay.\n- On the right is the actual Live Preview. In this particular workspace, it defaults to always showing `index.html`, although until you actually create the file as part of the instructions, you will instead see the `/home/workspace/` directory instead. \n\nThere is also a `index-solution.html` file already in the workspace that you can view if you get stuck, but make sure you first attempt a workspace before viewing the solution! Note this file *will not* show up in the Live Preview window unless you were to rename the file (in this case) to `index.html` (the file you should be doing your work in here).\n\n## Instructions\n\nCreate an `index.html` file and type in \"Hello World\" using a paragraph tag `<p>` and `</p>`. We'll cover more on the paragraph tag soon, but see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) for more on this tag.",

Other times, headings are used to define material, such as a film's title or an instructional article.\n\nHeadings are the primary way to outline the content of your webpage. They define the outline of your web page as both humans and search engines see it, which makes selecting relevant headings essential for a high-quality web page.\n\nThere are six distinct headings or heading components in HTML. Headings can be used for a multitude of reasons, such as titling segments, journals, or other types of content.\n\nOne way to think about headings on a web page is like headings in a book..\n\nThe `<h1>`, like the book title, introduces the topic that the web page is all about.\n\nThe `<h2>`, like book chapters, describe the main topics covered on the web page\n\nSmaller headers like the `<h3>` to `<h6>` serve as other sub-headings that can be used within each section, just like a book chapter can be as a book chapter may be split up by multiple sub-topics.\n\nHeadings are ordered from the biggest to the smallest size. There are 6 levels of headings available, ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, 1 being the most important one.\n\nH1 is used for the primary headings. For subheadings, all other lower headings are used.\n\n---\n\nHere's an example of headers:\n\n```\n<h1>Observable Universe</h1>\n<h2>Milky Way Galaxy</h2>\n<h3>Earth</h3>\n<h4>USA</h4>\n<h5>Norfolk, VA</h5>\n<h6>Main Street</h6>\n```\nWhich results in:\n\n<h1>Observable Universe</h1>\n<h2>Milky Way Galaxy</h2>\n<h3>Earth</h3>\n<h4>USA</h4>\n<h5>Norfolk, VA</h5>\n<h6>Main Street</h6>\n\n---\n\n#### Accessibility with Headers\n\nFor people who are blind or visually impaired, screen reading software is used to parse through text on a web page.\nA common technique these folks will use to navigate the page is to jump from heading to heading to determine the overall content of the page more easily.\nThat's why it's best practice to not skip one or more heading levels. If you did skip headings and went from `<h1>` to `<h3>`, you may cause confusion since the user has to deal with a missing heading.\nDon't bum out any of your users - structure your headings properly! 👍🏽\n",

The `href` attribute (hypertext reference) is used to define the destination of the link (where you navigate to when you click).\n\nThere are 3 types of destinations you can define:\n\n- anchor targets, to navigate within the same page \n- relative URLs, usually to navigate within the same website \n- absolute URLs, usually to navigate to another website\n\nYou can also use additional attributes besides `a` and `href`:\n- specify the relationship between the current and linked document with the `rel` attribute\n- specify where to open the linked document with the `target` attribute\n\nIn the example below, we are setting the URL destination to The Labrador Club website, preventing this website from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensuring it runs in a separate process with the `noopener` rel value. Finally we are requesting that the link open in a new window instead of the same one with the `_blank` target value.\n\n```\n<a href=\"https://thelabradorclub.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\n  >Join The Labrador Retriever Club</a>\n```",

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration. The declaration looks like this: \n\n```<!DOCTYPE html>```\n\nThis declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in `<!DOCTYPE html>` is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.\n\nIn the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the very beginning of your HTML documents.\n",

It goes above our `<body>` element.\n\n### Metadata\n\nThe `<head>` element contains the metadata for a web page.\n\nMetadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page.\n\nUnlike the information inside of the `<body>` tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself.\n\n### Title\n\nA browser’s tab displays the title specified in the `<title`> tag.

When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <p>This paragraph is a child of the body</p>\n</body>\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `<p>` element is nested inside the `<body>`element. The `<p>` element is considered a child of the `<body>` element, and the `<body>` element is considered the parent. You can also see that we’ve added two spaces of indentation (using the space bar) for better readability.\n\nSince there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.\n\nLet’s consider a more complicated example that uses some new tags:\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <div>\n    <h1>Sibling to p, but also grandchild of body</h1>\n    <p>Sibling to h1, but also grandchild of body</p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `<body>` element is the parent of the `<div>` element. Both the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements are children of the `<div>` element. Because the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements are at the same level, they are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the `<body>` element.\n\nAgain, understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element. You’ll learn more about webpage hierarchy when you start digging into CSS.\n",

              "text": "# Forms\n\nForms are a part of everyday life. When we use a physical form in real life, we write down information and give it to someone to process. Think of the times you’ve had to fill out information for various applications like a job, or a bank account, or dropped off a completed suggestion card — each instance is a form!\n\nJust like a physical form, an HTML `<form>` element is responsible for collecting information to send somewhere else. Every time we browse the internet we come into contact with many forms and we might not even realize it. There’s a good chance that if you’re typing into a text field or providing an input, the field that you’re typing into is part of a `<form>`!\n\nIn this lesson, we’ll go over the structure and syntax of a `<form>` and the many elements that populate it.\n\nHTML form elements let you collect input from your website’s visitors. Mailing lists, contact forms, and blog post comments are common examples for small websites, but in organizations that rely on their website for revenue, forms are sacred and revered.\n\nForms are the “money pages.” They’re how e-commerce sites sell their products, how SaaS companies collect payment for their service, and how non-profit groups raise money online. Many companies measure the success of their website by the effectiveness of its forms because they answer questions like “how many leads did our website send to our sales team?” and “how many people signed up for our product last week?” This often means that forms are subjected to endless A/B tests and optimizations.\n\nThere are multiple types of HTML forms, such as text input, text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, and buttons.",
