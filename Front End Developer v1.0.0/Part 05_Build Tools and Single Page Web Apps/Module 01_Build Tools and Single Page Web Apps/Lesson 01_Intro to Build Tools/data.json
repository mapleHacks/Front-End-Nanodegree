You have all the tools you need to make a fully functional website - and that’s awesome! But you might be asking - where do I go from here? In this course we are going to cover some tools that will take your front end web development skills to a professional level. We will focus on a build tool called Webpack and let it take us on a tour through all the most common technologies and strategies you’ll see in a professional front end project. \n\nThis course is really about a mental shift. Up to this point we have built toy apps for the purpose of learning that typically only have one user - us. But how does our development need to change in order to build, say, a large company website with a whole team of devs? We’re going to explore that and a whole lot more in the coming modules.",

One of my favorite browser dev tools is the Network tab. Go there and you can look at all the requests made by the page, separate them by type, see the http request responsible, see the response, etc.. I could do an entire course just on this tab probably.

              "text": "Build tools will manage all our assets so that we don’t have to by combining them all into a single file (or sometimes a few files). We create a set of rules for the build tool to follow, telling it specifically how we want each type of asset handled, and then it follows our rules, takes all the assets and bundles them into a single large file, which has everything loading in the correct order and is much easier for us to deal with. Typically, files with names like bundle or main are the result of a build tool combining many assets into one.\n\nWhat does it look like to write these rules for a build tool? Rules are written into config files. Just to give you a glimpse of where we’re headed, here is an example webpack config file. Don’t worry, this should look like gibberish right now, but we’re just going to take a look at a few things. \n\n\n```javascript\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\n    filename: 'main.js',\n  },\n  module: {\n       rules: [\n          {\n                test: /\\.js$/,\n                exclude: /node_modules/,\n                loader: \"babel-loader\",\n          },\n          {\n                test: /\\.html$/,\n                use: [{ loader: \"html-loader\"}],\n                },\n                {\n                    test: /\\.scss$/,\n                    use: [ 'style-loader', 'css-loader', 'sass-loader' ]\n                }\n       ]\n },\n  plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({\n           template: \"./src/html/index.html\",\n           filename: \"./index.html\",\n    })\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\nOne thing to notice is that we’re in javascript land! You can see that this config file is 100% normal javascript. Webpack is entirely built with js. \n\nYou can also see a whole section here in the middle titled “rules”. Not surprisingly, this is where we declare the rules that will govern our different assets. You might also have noticed that each rule targets a certain type of file with regex.",
