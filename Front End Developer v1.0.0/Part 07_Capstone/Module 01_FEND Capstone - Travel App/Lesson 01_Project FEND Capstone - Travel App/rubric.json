Multiple flights?\n- Integrate the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) to pull in data for the country being visited. \n- Allow the user to remove the trip.\n- Use [Local Storage](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/) to save the data so that when they close, then revisit the page, their information is still there. \n- Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.\n- Incorporate icons into forecast.\n- Allow user to Print their trip and/or export to PDF.\n- Allow the user to add a todo list and/or packing list for their trip.\n- Allow the user to add additional trips (this may take some heavy reworking, but is worth the challenge). \n  - Automatically sort additional trips by countdown.\n  - Move expired trips to bottom/have their style change so it’s clear it’s expired.",
